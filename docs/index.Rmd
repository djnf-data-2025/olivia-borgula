A demo notebook for Dow Jones News Fund data interns

During the week’s training, you will work on a project called Investigate Your Community to produce detailed story pitches relevant to their summer internship positions. The goal is to have the students research a topic relevant to your newsroom so they can get to work immediately at the internship. 

Here are some examples from last year’s DJNF data journalism training:

Hannah Rosenberger, at ASI Media/Counselor magazine, produced this analysis on name, image and likeness trends: https://hrosenberger.github.io/ASI-NIL-Project/

Shifra Dayak, an intern at the Connecticut Mirror, produced this analysis of environment spill data: https://shifradayak.github.io/DJNF_Merrill/ct_env_spills.html.

Michael Zhang, an intern at the Houston Landing, explored local election data: https://michaelzhangreporter.github.io/Houston_Campaign_Finance/


Here's what your newsroom suggested for a project
Rob,
 
Good morning! I wanted to get back to you about data for our summer intern to work on before I forgot. I chatted with Hannah Rosenberger (former intern, current superstar data analytics editor at ASI) to get her take since she went through the training program last year, and here’s an idea we thought would work:
 
How are cuts by the Trump administration affecting top markets in promo? Education is the biggest market that buys swag/merch, but the chart at the bottom of this story has a list of other markets: https://members.asicentral.com/news/strategy/july-2024/state-of-the-industry-combatting-anti-swag-sentiment/
 
One of my colleagues did a preliminary story in March about how Trump cuts were affecting education spending (though it’s more anecdotal): https://members.asicentral.com/news/industry-news/march-2025/education-market-sales-resilient-despite-federal-funding-uncertainties/
 
Hannah did a feature story that ran in February about the “white-collar recession” and what it means for the promo industry, with some great Flourish charts based on data from Indeed and the Bureau of Labor Statistics:  https://members.asicentral.com/news/strategy/february-2025/what-does-the-white-collar-recession-mean-for-promo/
 
Perhaps Olivia can look at some of the top markets for promo (Education, Healthcare, Construction, Manufacturing/Distribution & Financial/Insurance are the top 5) and analyze some data from Bureau of Labor Statistics and other sources to find trends in how they’re doing, etc.?
 
Let me know if that works for you, or if you need us to supply anything further. Thanks!
